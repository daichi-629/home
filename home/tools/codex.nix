    # hooks state, etc.), so a Nix-managed file would either be clobbered on
    # every codex invocation or would need to be read-only and fight the
    # tool. dotfiles/.codex/config.toml exists only as a reference template
    # for manual/first-time setup, not as something home-manager applies.
